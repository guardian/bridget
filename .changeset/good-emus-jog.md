Update Bridget Version to Set Minimum Requirement for Liveblogs

This version update introduces no changes to Bridget itself. Its sole purpose is to establish a minimum Bridget version requirement for DCAR liveblogs. This is necessary because Android recently fixed an ad-related bug, allowing DCAR liveblogs to be released in production.
