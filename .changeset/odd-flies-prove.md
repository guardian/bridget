Update bridget version after horizontal scroll release in prod

This version update doesn't have any changes in bridget. The Bridget version 8.1.0 that introduced Interaction service hadn't been fully implemented in the native app. Now the implementation is completed in the android, so we are updating bridget in order to rely on this version in MAPI for articles that need the Interaction service.
